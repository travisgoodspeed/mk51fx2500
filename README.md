Howdy y'all,

These are the ROM photographs of the Casio FX2500 and its clone, the
Електроника МК51.  All bits are marked, but these do not yet have
documented decoding settings in [Mask Rom
Tool](https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/maskromtool/).

See my article on page 32 of
[pocorgtfo22.pdf](https://github.com/angea/pocorgtfo/blob/master/releases/pocorgtfo22.pdf)
for details.

I've heard that Tomek Malensinski has a working emulator and the
appropriate settings.  I'll link those here as they are published.
