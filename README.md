Howdy y'all,

These are the ROM photographs of the Casio FX2500 and its clone, the
Електроника МК51.  All bits are marked, but these do not yet have
documented decoding settings in [Mask Rom
Tool](https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/maskromtool/).

See my article on page 32 of
[pocorgtfo22.pdf](https://github.com/angea/pocorgtfo/blob/master/releases/pocorgtfo22.pdf)
for details.

Tomek Malesinski has a repository on
[mk51fx2500re](https://github.com/tmalesinski/mk51fx2500re), that
includes a functioning emulator and documentation of the chip and its
instructions.
[mk51fx2500rom](https://github.com/tmalesinski/mk51fx2500rom) contains
his decoder for the ROM images, which have not yet been reincorporated
into Mask Rom Tool.
